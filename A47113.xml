            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>ANatomy, or the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Structure of Beaſts is as old as Sacrifices, which have been in uſe at leaſt ever ſince the Fall; and that of the Humane Body began with the Cuſtom of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balming the Dead, which is alſo very Ancient.</p>
            <p>But this Science has not had an Advancement proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to its Early beginning; for we find it but very Imperfect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Grecian</hi> Empire, where nevertheleſs it was more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ſtudied than for ſome time afterwards by the <hi>Romans,</hi> who, out of their too great Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, would not allow any,
<pb facs="tcp:59878:5"/>beſides their Prieſts to have the Inſpection of Bodies.</p>
            <p>In the Days of Ignorance, when all Knowledge ſeemed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o be Buried, this Science was alſo Neglected: But when the Reſt were Revived, this was alſo Cultivated. It has advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced daily ever ſince the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the laſt Century: And the preſent Age has not only rectified the many Miſtakes of the Ancients, diſcovered ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things, which they might have plainly ſeen, but alſo by their Glaſſes have far out-done the Scrutiny of the naked Eye, laying open ſuch things that the former Ages could never have known, becauſe they had no ſuch Helps.</p>
            <p>And, indeed, the Advantages of Anatomy are ſo many, and ſo great, that there is all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ply and promote the
<pb facs="tcp:59878:5"/>Knowledge of it. It has been always reckoned uſeful to Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, becauſe Phyſick cannot be rightly Adminiſtred without a due Knowledge of the Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture and Oeconomy of the Body; tho' it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, that the Practice of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick is neither much altered nor improved by the late cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Diſcoveries of Anatomy; yet they are no ſmall Help both to Phyſicians and Surge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for he, who knows his Subject beſt, can certainly Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe with greater Aſſurance, than he who knows little or nothing of it. He is not afraid of every thing which appears frightful, neither does he ſlight things which ſeem to be of leſs moment, which he knows may ſometimes foretell the greateſt Danger, whereas it is impoſſible that an Ignorant Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb facs="tcp:59878:6"/>can diſtinguiſh this, becauſe he can judge of things only by their outward Appearances. But abſtracting from Phyſick, Anatomy is very Uſeful, and therefore to be cultivated as a Special Part of Natural Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which affords as much Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, Satisfaction, and Profit, as any other Part whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. The Structure and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of the Body, is not only Admirable in it ſelf, and therefore very worthy to be conſidered; but alſo of great Uſe for ſuggeſting profitable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, and for perfecting Humane Art, by ſhewing how it may beſt imitate Nature. Thus Microſcopes and Optick-Glaſſes were made in imitation of the Eye, and the various Kinds of joining were taken from the different Ways the Bones are joined together. Thus
<pb facs="tcp:59878:6"/>the Obſervation of the Valves of the Heart and Veins taught us to uſe the ſame Device in the Air Pump and Wind Gun; and Chymiſts have learned their Diſſolutions, Digeſtions, Secretions, and other Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from what they find per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in the Body: And without doubt, after-Ages, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on further Diſcoveries and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations of the Structure and Oeconomy of Bodies, may be directed to ſeveral Uſeful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances for the Advantage of Life.</p>
            <p>I have not adventured to Publiſh the following Treatiſe from any Diſeſteem of what is already publiſhed by others; but as there are not ſo many Treatiſes of this Nature, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in Engliſh, as to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der New ones altogether Uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo I may, without Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<pb facs="tcp:59878:7"/>ſay, that this which we here offer to the Publick, is as full, and at leaſt as exact as any, according to the lateſt Diſcoveries, tho' it is much more brief than others, which are enlarged for the moſt part with Diſſertations, which are either Frivolous and Uſeleſs, or very tediouſly handled; both which tire the Reader's Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and alſo interrupt the Series of the Deſcription, which is chiefly to be obſerved.</p>
            <p>My Deſign was to give a ſmall Pocket-Book, in which, one, upon any Occaſion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much Reading, might have a full View of the Structure of any Part. And for this cauſe, I have followed the Method of that uſeful Epitome, written by Monſieur <hi>Bourdon,</hi> who has expreſſed ſome things, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in his firſt Chapter, ſo
<pb facs="tcp:59878:7"/>briefly, and yet altogether ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ully, as that I thought I could not do better than to Copy after them. Through all I have Carefully obſerved to give an Entire and Uninterrupted De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of ſuch Parts as have a dependence upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that by paſſing from one thing to another, in a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral order, I might avoid the Confuſion, which ſuch a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity of things would oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion otherwiſe. The Oſteo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy and Myology (I think) are very Plain and Exact for the Uſe of Surgeons, and in all there are ſeveral things which have ſcarcely been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved before. In this ſmall Treatiſe there are no Cuts, becauſe I am of the Opinion, that unleſs Cuts be extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily well done, they do more harm than good: and to have
<pb facs="tcp:59878:8"/>contrived fine Cuts for ſo ſmall a Volume, would have been both very Difficult and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive. This is ſufficient to them who have ſeen Diſſecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: And ſuch as are curious for Cuts may have, in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time, the beſt that have been ever done yet; for which the Publick will be exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly indebted to the Care of the Worthy and Exact Mr. <hi>Cooper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will not anſwer for all that I have ſaid upon the uſe of the Parts; it was ſufficient for a Compend to have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the common Opinions, or thoſe that ſeemed to me moſt probable, which I have drawn for the moſt part from the Structure of the Parts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſo as that the Reaſons for them do eaſily appear. I have ſpoken: with a greater
<pb facs="tcp:59878:8"/>aſſurance of thoſe things of which we have a clearer Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, whil'ſt other things are only put off with a <hi>Perhaps,</hi> or a <hi>May be:</hi> And in ſome things I have been content to ſhew only the Weakneſs of the common Opinions.</p>
            <p>The Knowledge of the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Oeconomy, and of the Uſe of the ſeveral Parts of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is very deſirable, but it is to be obtained only by Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation and Experience; the Progreſs, which is made by following this Method, may indeed be ſomewhat ſlow, but it is ſure and ſolid, and will give greater Satisfaction to the Lovers of Truth, than all the ſubtile Syſtems, which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed but ſo many Philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Romances; becauſe they are not built upon Matters of Fact, but upon Precarious and
<pb facs="tcp:59878:9"/>Imaginary Hypotheſes. <hi>Cart<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to true Philoſophy, and has very much hindred the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of the Knowledge of other Parts of Nature as well as of this of which we now treat. An ingenious Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, or well-contrived Play, may give ſome pleaſant Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion; but every Wiſe Man will prefer a true Hiſtory to the beſt of them. Even ſo the Knowledge which comes by true Obſervation and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, is preferrable by far to the Syſtems of the moſt Ingenious Virtuoſo, who has not been at the pains to trace Nature, but only conſulted his own Fancy. Truth is to be ſearched after and not Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Appearances: Nor can we
<pb facs="tcp:59878:9"/>ever know the Truth, but by conſidering attentively what <hi>de facto</hi> is; for many things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear Rational, which are not True. How long might we have reaſoned about the Uſe of the <hi>Tubae Fallopianae,</hi> and have been never a whit the Wiſer, if Obſervations and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments had not taught us their true Uſe? Who could ever have imagined, that a Tube, which lay looſe in the Cavity of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> ſhould, in the time of Conception, move towards the <hi>Ovarium,</hi> and embrace it for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the Egg? If the Diſſection of Animals, after their Conception, had not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated the Truth of this to us, ſome fancied other U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of them, and others would have ſtudied to render this ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, as if theſe Tubes were
<pb facs="tcp:59878:10"/>thereby made intelligent Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, capable to know the time of Conception, and the place where the <hi>Ovaria</hi> lie. When Men reaſon either in Anatomy or other things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making Obſervation and Experience their Guide, they often take Truths for Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods, and Falſhoods for Truths, which is of very bad Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence when they come to practiſe upon theſe Suppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And hence it is that thoſe Phyſicians and Surgeons are the worſt Practitioners, and the leaſt ſucceſsful who are too much addicted to ſome Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical and uncertain Syſtems, and who proceed upon the Truth of them.</p>
            <p>How many fine Diſcourſes have we upon the uſe of the Parts of the Brain, upon Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, upon the uſe of the
<pb facs="tcp:59878:10"/>Spleen, upon Generation and Secretion of the Humours, and upon the Motion of the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles? How much wiſer are we for them all? Who dare be Poſitive in determining the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of theſe Parts, or that they perform their Functions ſuch a way, and no other ways? I wiſh Men would give their true Obſervations and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, without the addition of their Conjectures and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings, which for the moſt Part do amuſe and perplex the Reader. If Obſervations were nakedly delivered, I doubt not but we ſhould come ſooner to a greater and clearer Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Nature, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of Anatomy. I do not Promiſe, that the Whole of Nature may be found out, or that the whole Animal Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy may be diſcovered; for
<pb facs="tcp:59878:11"/>there are ſome Parts whoſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Situation put it out of our Power to make ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Experiments as are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to lay open their true Uſes and Functions: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a perfect and complete Knowledge of the Oeconomy of the Body is hardly to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, becauſe our Reaſon alone is not ſufficient to procure it: and where Obſervation fails, we reaſon but in the Dark, and are very liable to Miſtakes. There can be no true Science without certain Axioms and Principles; and thoſe proper for Anatomy muſt only be true Obſervations and undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Experiments; What is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently drawn from them ought to be received as certain Truths, but what is delivered without Obſervation and Experience, or raiſed from doubtful Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb facs="tcp:59878:11"/>is uncertain Conjecture, and little to be regarded. As a Blind Man can never reaſon rightly about Light, nor make any Progreſs in the Knowledge of it; becauſe he hath neither any true Notion of Light, nor can he be ſenſible of the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of it; even ſo we can never diſcover the Uſe of thoſe Parts of the Body, whoſe En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Compoſition and Texture are without the reach of our Sight and Obſervation. And after all, tho' we knew the whole Compoſition of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and the ſeveral Parts; yet it would require the very height of Reaſon and Geometry to Underſtand and Comprehend perfectly the Contrivance of it; which made the Pſalmiſt ſay, <hi>I am fearfully and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully made.</hi> And which ſhews, that Anatomy is a Noble and
<pb facs="tcp:59878:12"/>Curious Study, proper for the moſt Ingenious Spirits, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way moſt worthy of their Pains and Contemplation.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Its Situation.</note>The <hi>Oeſophagus,</hi> or Gullet, is a long, large, and round Canal which deſcends from the Mouth, lying all along be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Aſpera Arteria</hi> and the <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebrae</hi> of the Neck and Back, to the fifth <hi>Vertebra</hi> of the Back, where it turns a little to the right, and gives way to the <hi>Aorta Deſcendens,</hi> and both run by one another till at the ninth, the <hi>Oeſophagus</hi> turns again to the left, climbs above the <hi>Aorta,</hi> and deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing above it, it pierces the Midriff, and is continued to the left Orifice of the Stomach.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Its Coats.</note>The Gullet is compoſed of three Coats; The Firſt and Internal, which covers all the Cavity of the Gullet, is made of nervous Fibres diverſly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven; this Coat at its upper end doth
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59878:29"/>join the internal Membrane of the Mouth and Lips, therefore in Vomiting theſe Parts are affected, and at its lower end it covers the left Orifice of the Stomach internally for three Fingers breadth: This Coat is ſoft and downy towards the Cavity; but more at the Orifice of the Stomach, than it is any where elſe.</p>
                  <p>The Second Coat of the Gullet is very thick and fleſhy, it reſembles a true Muſcle, its Fibres run in two Spiral Lines which croſs one another: by the Motions of this Coat, the Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaltick Motion of the Gullet is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
                  <p>The Third and outermoſt, which covers the other two, is very thin, compoſed of ſmall and ſlender mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous Fibres, it comes from the <hi>Pleura.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Among theſe Coats there are ſome ſmall Glands, whoſe excretory Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels open in the Cavity of the <hi>Oeſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phagus,</hi> for the moiſtening of it. The Gullet at its upper end receives an Artery from the <hi>Aorta,</hi> and it ſends a Vein to the <hi>Azygos:</hi> At its lower end it has an Artery from the <hi>Caeliaca,</hi> and it gives a Vein to the <hi>Coronaria</hi> of the Stomach. Its Nerves are from the eighth Pair.</p>

                     </note>The upper end of the Gullet is called <hi>Pharynx.</hi> It has two pair of Muſcles for its Motion. The Firſt is the <hi>Stylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pharyngaeus.</hi> This is a ſmall and round Muſcle, which ariſes fleſhy from the root of the <hi>Proceſſus Styloides,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending obliquely, it is inſerted into the ſides of the <hi>Pharynx.</hi> When this Muſcle acteth it pulleth up and dilateth the <hi>Pharynx.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Second is the <hi>Oeſophagaeus.</hi> Its Fibres have ſeveral Directions; its ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Fibres ariſe from the <hi>Proceſſus Pterigoidaeus</hi> of the <hi>Os Sphaenoides,</hi> and from the <hi>Cornua</hi> of the <hi>Os Hyoides,</hi> and run obliquely to the back-part of the <hi>Pharynx;</hi> the Fibres which are below theſe ariſe from the ſides of the <hi>Carti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lago Scutiformis,</hi> and run tranſverſly to the middle of the back part of the <hi>Pharynx,</hi> where both ſuperiour and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Fibres from both ſides unite and form a tendinous Line. When this Muſcle acts, it draws the back part of the <hi>Pharynx</hi> to its forepart, by which it not only ſtraitens it for the depreſſing of the Aliment, but it compreſſes alſo the <hi>Tonſillae</hi> which ſend out their Liquor, which lubri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates the Aliment whereby it glides the more eaſily down into the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach.</p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:59878:30"/>
                  <p>There are two Glands which are tied on the backſide of the Gullet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the fifth <hi>Vertebra</hi> of the Back, by the branches of Nerves which come from the eighth Pair. Theſe two Glands are like two Kidney-beans tied together;<note place="margin">Its Glands.</note> they receive Veins and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries from the <hi>Coronariae,</hi> and they have Lymphatick Veſſels which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge themſelves into the Thoracick Duct. Their uſe is to defend (as ſome ſay) the Gullet againſt the hardneſs of the <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> and to moiſten its Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity for facilitating the deſcent of the Aliment. But it's more likely that theſe Glands are for ſeparating a Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha from the Blood, as others do. <hi>Bartholine</hi> remarks that theſe Glands ſometimes ſwell ſo big as to hinder the deſcent of the Aliments into the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Its uſe.</note>The uſe of the Gullet is to carry the Meat from the Mouth into the Stomach, by means of the Muſcles of the <hi>Pharynx,</hi> and fleſhy Fibres of the <hi>Gula</hi> which perform its Periſtaltick Motion.</p>

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59878:30"/>the Liver covers a part of its right Side, the Spleen touches it on the left Side, and the <hi>Colon</hi> at its bottom, to which alſo the Caul is tied.<note place="margin">Its Figure.</note> Its figure reſembles a Bag-pipe, being long, large, wide, and pretty round at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, but ſhorter and leſs Convex on its upper part, where it has two Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, one at each end, which are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what higher than the middle between them. The Superior or left Orifice is called <gap reason="foreign">

At this Orifice the Tunicles of the Stomach are much thicker than they are any where elſe, and the inmoſt has a thick and ſtrong Duplicature, which ſerves as a Valve to the <hi>Pylorus</hi> when it contracts and ſhuts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Its Coats.</note>The Stomach is made of four Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes or Coats; The firſt and inmoſt is made of ſhort Fibres, which ſtand perpendicularly upon the Fibres of the next Coat; they are to be ſeen plainly towards the <hi>Pylorus.</hi> This Coat is much larger than the reſt, being it is full of Plaits and wrinkles, and chiefly about the <hi>Pylorus:</hi> Theſe Plaits retard the Chyle, that it run not out of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59878:31"/>before it be ſufficiently digeſted. In this Coat there are alſo a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſmall Glands which ſeparate a Liquor, which beſmears all the Cavity of the Stomach; therefore this Coat is called <hi>Tunica Glanduloſa.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Second is much finer and thiner; it is altogether nervous; it is of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite ſenſe, and it's called <hi>Nervoſa.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Third is Muſcular, being made of ſtraight and circular Fibres; the ſtraight run upon the upper Part of the Stomach, between its ſuperior and inferior Orifices, and the circular run obliquely from the upper part of the Stomach to the bottom. Theſe Fibres by their Contraction and continual Motion help the attrition and digeſtion of the Aliments.</p>
                  <p>The Fourth Tunicle is common, it comes from the <hi>Peritonaeum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Stomach receives Veins from the <hi>Porta,</hi>

                  <p>The Eight pair of Nerves or <hi>Par vagum</hi> gives two conſiderable branches to the Stomach, which deſcending by the ſides of the Gullet, divide each into
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59878:31"/>two branches, the External and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. The two External branches unite in one, and the Internal do ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, both which piercing the Midriff, form, by a great number of ſmall twigs, upon the upper Orifice of the Stomach, a <hi>Plexus,</hi> and then the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal branch ſpreads its ſelf down to the bottom of the Stomach: and the External branch ſpreads it ſelf upon the inſide about the upper Orifice of the Stomach. This great number of Nerves, which is about the upper Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, renders it very ſenſible, and from them alſo proceeds the great Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy betwixt the Stomach, Head, and Heart; upon which account <hi>Van Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> thought, that the Soul had its ſeat in the upper Orifice of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Plexus Nervoſus</hi> of the <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondria</hi> and <hi>Meſenterium</hi> give ſeveral branches to the bottom of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, therefore in Hyſterick and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pochondriack Paſſions the Stomach is alſo affected.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Their Coats.</note> They are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of three Coats. The inmoſt is nervous, and very ſenſible; it is full of circular wrinkles and Plaits which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard the motion of the Chyle and deſcent of the Excrements. It is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with a mucous ſort of cruſt, which defends it againſt the Acrimony of the Bile. In this cruſt there are an infinite number of ſmall Glands; they are placed as it were by Plotouns in the ſmall Guts, but in the great Guts they are fewer, and are placed one by one; they lie only in that ſide of the Inteſtine which is knit to the Meſentery.

                  <p>The ſecond Coat is made of Spiral and ſtraight Fibres. The Spiral Fibres contract the Cavity of the Inteſtines when they act, and the ſtraight Fibres ſhorten the Inteſtines when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract.</p>

Others again think, That the Arteries and Veins are but one continued Canal, and that at the Extremity of the Artery or begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Vein, there goes out a Veſſel called the <hi>Excretory Duct,</hi> through which the Humour paſſes, and theſe Ducts have circular Orifices, which differ from one another only in mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59878:39"/>The Learned <hi>Bellinus</hi> ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly imagines, That a Gland is only a ſingle Cylindrical Tube, which may be either Straight, Spiral, or otherwiſe Crooked; from which there goes one or more Excretory Ducts, as the <hi>Venae Lacteae</hi> go from the Inteſtines. This Tube at one end is continued to the Artery, and at the other to the Vein, both which are of a Conical Figure.</p>
                  <p>There are as many or more Opinions about the way the Humours are ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated. The Ancients maintained that it was done by Ferments: but as theſe Ferments muſt mix with the Blood, to ſeparate the Humours from it; ſo they muſt be exhauſted, and there muſt be another Ferment to ſeparate more, and another to ſeparate this; and ſo on <hi>ad infinitum.</hi> Beſides, it is impoſſible, That any Liquor can lie in any particular place (as the Ferments are ſuppoſed to be) through which other Liquors run con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, and not be carried away with the moving Liquors. Upon theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, the Learned <hi>Bellinus,</hi> in his Treatiſe, <hi>De motu Cordis &amp; Bilis,</hi> thinks, That the Air might be this Ferment. But beſides, that it may be doubted, whether there is any Air in the Blood, or not: it will be hard to conceive how the ſame Ferment and the ſame Structure of Glands can ſeparate diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59878:39"/>forts of Liquors in the ſeveral Parts of the Body. But I wiſh he had been more particular, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained his Opinion more fully. Thoſe who maintain, that the Glands have Pores or Cavities of different Figures ſay, that none but Bodies of ſuch Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures can enter them; and therefore ſuch and ſuch Liquors are always ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in ſuch and ſuch Glands. But if they did conſider, that Liquors are Suſceptible of all Figures, and that membranous Tubes will yield to any Figure, and that all Bodies of a leſſer Diameter than that of the Gland may paſs through, they would have little reaſon to be of this Opinion. Thoſe who think, that the Glands differ only in magnitude, ſay, That only Liquors of ſuch and ſuch Magnitudes can paſs through ſuch and ſuch Glands, have no reaſon to brag of it: for if the Bile is made of Parts, which are bigger than thoſe of the Urine, and the Parts of the Urine bigger than thoſe of the Spittle, then the Spittle may paſs where the Urine paſſes, and both may paſs through the Glands of the Liver: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, there is no Liquor which has not ſmaller and greater Parts, ſo that Parts of the groſſeſt Liquors would be found ſeparate in the fineſt Glands. It were tedious to run over all the Opinions
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59878:40"/>which are publiſhed upon this Subject. The Ingenious Dr. <hi>Cockburn,</hi> has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us one in his <hi>Oeconomia Animalis,</hi> drawn from the different Velocities of the Blood, which certainly ought to be conſidered in this Affair.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Vena Porta</hi> and the <hi>Cava</hi> enter the Liver by its Concave ſide, and are equally diſtributed thorow all its Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; where ever there is a branch of the one, there is a branch of the other; ſo that each Lobe, and each Gland in the Love, whether on the Convex or Concave ſide, receive the ſame Veſſels.

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59878:63"/>They have Nerves from the Vertebral Pairs, and from the ſixth Part of the Brain.</p>
                  <p>The uſe of the Dugs is to ſeparate the Milk for the Nouriſhment of the <hi>Foetus.</hi> The Arteries which terminate in the Glands, which compoſe the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Dugs, bring the Blood pregnate with a Chyle which has recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved its laſt Perfection by its Circulation thorow the Lungs; this Chyle being ſeparated by the Glands of the Dugs, runs thorow the <hi>Tubuli Lactiferi</hi> upon the Suction of the Child.</p>

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:59878:70"/>one, and open into the right Ear; where they unite, there is a little Protube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance made by their Coats on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the Canal like an <hi>Iſthmus,</hi> which directs the Blood both of the one and the other into the Ear, and ſo hinders them from ruſhing upon one another. The right Ear in its <hi>Diaſtole</hi> receives the Blood from the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> which by its <hi>Syſtole</hi> is thruſt into the right Ventricle; (for the tendinous Circle which is at the Mouth of the <hi>Cava</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, and hinders the Blood to return into it,) which at the ſame time is in its <hi>Diaſtole;</hi> in the <hi>Syſtole</hi> of the right Ventricle the Blood is thruſt into the <hi>Arteria Pulmonaria,</hi> (for it cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into the Ear, becauſe of the <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulae Tricuſpides</hi>) which communicates with the <hi>Vena Pulmonaria,</hi> which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries back the Blood into the left Ear, which in its <hi>Syſtole,</hi> thruſts the Blood into the left Ventricle which is then in its <hi>Diaſtole.</hi> In the <hi>Syſtole</hi> of this Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle, the Blood is thruſt into the <hi>Aorta;</hi> (for it cannot return into the Ear, becauſe of the <hi>Valunlae Mitrales</hi>) which carries it thorow all the Body. Now the <hi>Aorta,</hi> when it comes out of the Heart, aſcends a little upwards, and then turns downwards to form the deſcending Trunk, becauſe the Blood might offend the Brain, if it
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:59878:70"/>ran with that impetuoſity with which it's thrown out of the Heart; and from the upper ſide of this turning, the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vical and Axillary Veſſels do ariſe: by this artifice the Blood collides againſt the ſides of the <hi>Aorta;</hi> its force is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; part of it is taken in by the Mouths of the aſcending branches, but its greateſt part is directed down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Of the Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Blood in the <hi>Foetus.</hi>
                     </note>Let us now conſider which way the Blood circulates in the <hi>Foetus;</hi> for this you muſt obſerve, that in the right Ear, on the lower ſide of the Protu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berance of the <hi>Cava,</hi> juſt oppoſite to the Mouth of the <hi>Cava Deſcendens,</hi> there is a hole called the <hi>Foramen Ovale,</hi> which opens into the <hi>Vena Pulmonaria;</hi> this hole has a Valve, which ſuffers the Blood to enter the Vein, but hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it to come back again. There is likewiſe a Paſſage or Canal called <hi>Ductus Bottali,</hi> which comes from the Trunk of the <hi>Arteria Pulmonaria,</hi> and goes to the Trunk of the <hi>Aorta.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the Blood which comes from the <hi>Placenta,</hi> by the Umbilical Vein into the <hi>Porta,</hi> is ſent into the <hi>Cava,</hi> by a Canal, which goes ſtraight from the Trunk of the <hi>Porta,</hi> to the Trunk of the <hi>Cava</hi> in the Liver. This aſcends the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> and is directly thrown thorow the <hi>Foramen Ovale,</hi> into the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:59878:71"/>
                     <hi>Vena Pulmonaria,</hi> which carries it into the left Ventricle, which throws it into the <hi>Aorta,</hi> to be diſtributed thorow all the Body. But the Blood which comes down the <hi>Vena Cava aſcendens,</hi> is diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the <hi>Iſthmus</hi> of the <hi>Cava,</hi> from the <hi>Foramen Ovale,</hi> and falls into the right Ventricle, which thruſts it into the <hi>Arteria Pulmonaria,</hi> from whence it's immediately carried by the <hi>Ductus Bottali</hi> into the <hi>Aorta,</hi> to be mixt with the reſt of the Blood. By this you ſee, that the Blood which comes from the <hi>Vena Cava deſcendens,</hi> paſſes only thorow the left Ventricle, whilſt the Blood which comes from the <hi>Cava aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendens,</hi> paſſes only thorow the right Ventricle.</p>
                  <p>Thus having ſhewed what way and by what means the Blood circulates thorow the Heart; let us now reflect a little upon the quickneſs of its motion. Each Ventricle will at leaſt contain an Ounce of Blood, and therefore we may ſafely ſuppoſe that the Heart throws into the <hi>Aorta,</hi> an Ounce of Blood every time it contracts. The Heart contracts 4000 times in one Hour, or ſometimes more and ſometimes leſs, according to the different Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Sexes and Ages: from which it follows, that there paſſes thorow the Heart every hour 4000 Ounces,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:59878:71"/>or 350 Pound of Blood. Now the whole maſs of Blood is but about 25 Pound; ſo that a quantity of Blood equal to the whole maſs of Blood, paſſes thorow the Heart 14 times in one hour, which is about once every 4 minutes. I ſay, a quantity which is equal to the whole maſs of Blood, and not the whole maſs it ſelf; for it is not to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that the Blood which goes to the Extremities can return to the Heart as ſoon as the Blood which goes only to the Kidneys or Liver.</p>
                  <p>The Velocity and quantity of Blood, together with the time it takes to run in different Blood Veſſels, differ accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the different lengths and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the Veſſels, according to the greater and leſſer Compreſſion the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels receive in the different Parts tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row which they run, according to diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent quantity of Secretions from the Veſſels in the ſeveral Parts of the Body, according as the Veſſels have more or leſs turnings and windings, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as they divide into more of fewer branches. Theſe things determinate the Velocity, Time, and Quantity of Blood in the ſeveral Veſſels of the Body.</p>
                  <p>In the Blood there is much volatile Salt and Spirits, ſome Phlegm and Sulphur, a little Earth, but little or
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:59878:72"/>no fixt Salt. Alcali's diſſolve it, and Acids coagulate it.</p>

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:59878:74"/>but inſtead of them they have ſmall circular Ligaments, which contract and dilate for the reception and expulſion of the Air.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Of its Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes.</note>Theſe Cartilages are tied together by two Membranes, the one external, and the other internal. The external is compoſed of circular Fibres; it covers the whole <hi>Trachea</hi> externally. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal is of an exquiſite ſenſe, it covers the Cartilages internally. It is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of three diſtinct Membranes. The Firſt is woven of two Orders of Fibres. Thoſe of the firſt Order are Longitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, for the ſhortening the <hi>Trachea;</hi> they make the Cartilages approach and enter one another. The other Order is of circular Fibres, for the contracting the Cartilages.

                     <note place="margin">Of the uſe of the Lungs.</note>Having thus conſidered the Structure of the Lungs, 'tis evident that the Air enters by the <hi>Trachea</hi> into the Veſicles, and ſo ſwells and dilates the Subſtance of the Lungs in Inſpiration; but in Expiration theſe Veſicles contract, and thruſt out the Air, which carries a great deal of excrementitious Vapours from the Blood along with it, by the Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticity of their Fibres, by the help of the Nerves, and by the preſſure of the ſurrounding Bodies employed in reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. It is alſo evident, that the Blood is carried from the Heart by the <hi>Arteria Pulmonaria,</hi> thorow all the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Lungs, and that the ſame Blood is taken up by the <hi>Vena Pulmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naria,</hi> and carried back again to the Heart. And we are ſure, that whilſt the Blood paſſes thorow the Lungs, that it receives ſome alteration; for the Blood in the <hi>Arteria Pulmonaria</hi> is of a dark colour, as venal Blood; but that which is in the Vein is of a florid red, as Arterial Blood; yet how this Alteration is made is not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by Anatomiſts.</p>
                  <p>Some conſidering that the Surface of venal Blood, drawn in a Pellet and expoſed to the Air, turns to the colour of Arterial Blood; do think that the nitrous Particles of the Air which we breath, paſſes thorow the Tunicles of
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:59878:75"/>the Veſſels, and mixes with the Blood, and cauſes this Alteration, which they ſay is neceſſary for the recruiting of the Animal Spirits, and for the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the natural heat of the Blood, by fermenting with the Sulphureous Parts of the Aliments.</p>
                  <p>Others explain this Alteration only by the beating and agitation of the Air upon the bloody Veſſels of the Lungs, which indeed is ſufficient to cauſe this Alteration; and the neceſſity of this beating appears by an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment, which is this; take a little new drawn Blood, look to it imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately thorow a Microſcope, you ſhall ſee a number of ſmall, red glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bules, ſwimming in a thin and clear Liquor; and the longer you look, the more of theſe Globules join in one, and the bigger they grow, till at laſt they all come into one, and the Liquor is ſeparated by its ſelf, and then the Blood is coagulated.</p>
                  <p>Thus the red Globules of the Blood in the Veins as they return from the Extremities, grow bigger and bigger, for the want of being agitated: And if they were not ſeparated and broken into many ſmaller Particles, they would ſoon cauſe a ſtagnation in the Capil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary Veſſels. So the beating of the Air in Inſpiration and Expiration is
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:59878:75"/>neceſſary for the attenuating, ſubtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, and intimately mixing the Chyle, <hi>Lympha,</hi> and other Parts of the Blood.</p>

                  <p>Its Natural Figure is round, but a little flat upon its Sides; round, that it might contain the greater quantity of Brains; and flat upon its Sides, that the bounds of the Sight may be the larger, or rather that the Ears might not be too much expoſed to danger.</p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:59878:78"/>
                  <p>We have divided the external Parts of the Head into two, the Face and the hairy Scalp; we ſhall now divide it into the Containing and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Parts. The Containing Parts are the Skin with the Hair upon it, the <hi>Pericranium,</hi> the Skull, and the two <hi>Meninges.</hi> Of the Skin and Hair we have already ſpoken; of the Skull we ſhall ſpeak in its proper place.</p>
                  <p>Anatomiſts do generally ſay, that the Skull is covered both with a <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cranium</hi> and a <hi>Perioſteum,</hi> but they have taken the <hi>Aponeuroſis</hi> of the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipital and Frontal Muſcles for one of them. Theſe Muſcles lie immediately under the Skin. The firſt two are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Frontales.</hi> Their fleſhy Fibres are inſertedinto the Eye-brows, from thence they go ſtraight up the <hi>Os frontis,</hi> and are continued by a long and large <hi>Aponeuroſis</hi> to that of the <hi>Occipitales;</hi> they adhere cloſely to the Skin of the Forehead, which they pull upwards. The other two Muſcles, which are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Occipitales,</hi> have their fleſhy Fibres fixed to the Skin of the Hind-head, which they alſo pull upwards: They are ſhort, broad, and thin, and they end in a large <hi>Aponeuroſis,</hi> which joins that of the Frontals, and both together cover the whole Skull.</p>

The External hath upon its upper Part, and particularly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the tip of the Tongue, a great number of <hi>Papillae,</hi> of a Pyramidal Figure; they ſtand not up ſtraight, but incline towards the baſis of the Tongue; they appear not ſo plainly in Men as in Brutes, in ſome of which laſt they grow Cartilaginous. Each <hi>Papilla</hi> has a ſmall root, which makes a ſmall hole in the viſcous Subſtance, which lies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Membranes. In Men the chief uſe of theſe <hi>Papillae Pyrami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dales</hi> ſeems to be for preſerving the <hi>Papillae Nervoſae,</hi> which are of a ſofter Subſtance, that they be not hurt by the hardneſs or roughneſs of the Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: And in Beaſts, which feed upon Graſs, which they gather toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their Tongue, theſe <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillae</hi>
                     <pb n="178" facs="tcp:59878:102"/>are like ſo many Hooks for the graſping, cutting, and pulling of the Graſs; and perhaps by their roughneſs rubbing upon the Palate, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to preſs the Spittle out of the Glands.</p>
                  <p>Under the External Membrane there lies a thin viſcous Subſtance which is white, on that ſide next the External Membrane, and black on that ſide next the Internal. When the Tongue is boiled, this Subſtance hardens, and is like a Searce being full of ſmall holes, made by the roots of the <hi>Papillae Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midales.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Internal Membrane is thin and ſoft; upon it there appear ſeveral <hi>Papillae</hi> made of the Extremities of the Nerves of the Tongue, therefore they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Nervoſae:</hi> They are ſituated upon the ſides of the Tongue, but chiefly towards its tip; they reſemble the ſmall Horns of a Snail; for their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities are round and bigger than the reſt of their Bodies. The Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of each <hi>Papilla</hi> pierces the Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Membrane of the Tongue. They quit thoſe holes, and remain on the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Membrane, when the External is raiſed. Theſe <hi>Papillae</hi> are the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Organ of Taſting.</p>

                  <p>The firſt or External Plan is made of ſtraight Fibres, which ſurround the Tongue, reaching from its Baſis to its Point; when they contract they ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the Tongue. Under them there are ſeveral Plans of Fibres, which run from one edge of the Tongue to the other; they draw the edges of the Tongue together. There are alſo ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Plans of Fibres, which run from the under to the upper ſide of the Tongue; when they contract, they make the Tongue broad and thin. Theſe two ſorts of Fibres croſs one another at right Angles, and they lie <hi>Stratum ſuper Stratum,</hi> from the tip of the Tongue to its baſis; firſt a Plan of one ſort, and then a Plan of the other ſort. There is ſome Fat betwixt theſe Fibres, but chiefly towards the baſis of the Tongue.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Of the Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment of the Bones.</note>The Bones are made up of hard Fibres, tied to one another by ſmall tranſverſe Fibres, as thoſe of the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are. In a <hi>Foetus</hi> thoſe Fibres are porous, ſoft, and eaſily diſcerned. It is probable that they are nouriſhed by the Serous or Lymphatick Part of the Blood, which is brought to them by the Arteries, and carried back by the Veins. As their Pores fill, with a Subſtance of their own Nature, ſuch as we ſuppoſe the <hi>Lympha</hi> to be, ſo they encreaſe, harden, and grow cloſe to one another; but when their Pores are full of this Subſtance, then the Bones are grown to their outmoſt
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:59878:105"/>extent, hardneſs, and ſolidity, their Blood-Veſſels being compreſſed on all ſides by their bony Channels, bring no more Blood than what is ſufficient to ſupply the places of their decaying Particles.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of the Marrow.</note>All the Bones of the Body, which have any conſiderable thickneſs, have either a large Cavity, or they are Spongeous, and full of little Cells, in both the one and the other, there is an oleaginous Subſtance called Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, contained in proper Veſicles or Membranes, which is ſeparate from the Nouriſhment of the Bones, that they may harden; for as ſoon as the Marrow appears the Bones turn firm and ſolid, but is ſtill continued in the Cavity and little Cells to ſupple the Fibres of the Bones, that they may be leſs apt to break.</p>
                  <p>All the Bones of the Body, except the Teeth, and thoſe of the Ear, and where the Bones are articulate to one another, are covered with a thin, but cloſe and ſtrong Membrane called <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſteum;</hi> it has an exquiſite ſenſe, which gives me ground to think, that it is an Expanſion of ſome of the tendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Fibres of the Muſcles.

The Cavities are of two ſorts, either narrow and ſhallow, or wide and deep. The firſt ſort is called <hi>Glene;</hi> the ſecond <hi>Cotyle.</hi> But in deſcribing the Bones in particular, we ſhall alſo deſcribe their Cavities. The Protu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berances are alſo of two ſorts, <hi>viz.

Both the one and the other are ordinarily upon the Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of the Bones, and they are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the Inſertions of Muſcles whoſe force they greatly augment, or for the Articulation of the Bones. All their difference is from their Figure. If it be a large and round Protuberance, it is called <hi>Caput,</hi> and the Part immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately under it, <hi>Cervix;</hi> but if it be ſmall and round, then it is called <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dylus.</hi> If it be a ſharp Protuberance, then it is called <hi>Corone, Styloides, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racoides,</hi> &amp;c. according to its Figure.</p>

                  <p>A Cartilage is a ſmooth and ſolid Body, ſofter than a Bone, but harder than a Ligament. In it there are no Cavities nor Cells, for contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Marrow, nor is it covered with any Membrane to make it ſenſible, as the Bones are. The Cartilages have all a natural reſort, by which, if they are forced from their Natural figure or ſituation, they return to it of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as ſoon as the force is taken away. They are chiefly in thoſe places where a ſmall and eaſie motion is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, as in the Ears, Noſe, <hi>Larynx, Trachea Arteria,</hi> and <hi>Sternum;</hi> and their Natural Elaſticity ſerves inſtead of Antagoniſt Muſcles. They cover al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the ends of all the Bones, which are joined together for motion. Firſt, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſmoother than the Bones. Secondly, Becauſe they are without ſenſe. And Thirdly, Being ſofter than the Bones, the Attrition which is made by the motion of the Joint, is the more eaſily ſupplied.</p>
                  <p>A Ligament is a white and ſolid Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſofter than a Cartilage, but harder than a Membrane; they have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:59878:106"/>Cavities, neither have they any ſenſe, leſt they ſhould always ſuffer upon the motion of the Joint. Their chief uſe is to faſten the Bones, which are articulated for motion toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, leſt they ſhould be diſlocated in any violent motion.</p>

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Of the joining of the Bones.</note>THE Bones are articulated to one another two ways. The Firſt, which is called <hi>Diarthroſis,</hi> is when the Articulation is with a manifeſt motion. The Second is when the Articulation is without motion, and it is called <hi>Synar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throſis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are three ſorts of the <hi>Diar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throſis,</hi> viz. <hi>Enarthroſis, Arthrodia,</hi> and <hi>Ginglimus.</hi> The <hi>Enarthroſis</hi> is when a large Head is received into a deep Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, ſuch as the Articulation of the <hi>Femur</hi> with the <hi>Iſchium;</hi> and this ſort of joining is called by Tradeſmen, the Ball and Socket, which is uſed in large Mathematical Inſtruments, for the turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them to any ſide. <hi>Arthrodia</hi> is when a ſmall Head is received into a ſhallow <hi>Sinus,</hi> as the <hi>Radius</hi> receives the <hi>Humerus.</hi> Tho' Authors have counted the <hi>Enarthroſis</hi> and the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throdia</hi> as two diſtinct Articulations,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:59878:107"/>yet we ſee no reaſon why they ſhould be ſo; for as they ſay, <hi>Majus &amp; Minus non variant ſpeciem.</hi> The <hi>Ginglimus</hi> is when a Bone both receives and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; and this ſort of Articulation admits only of the motions of Flexion and Extenſion; and it is called by Tradeſmen <hi>Charnall,</hi> and it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly uſed in hinges. Of this Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation there are three ſorts. The firſt is when the end of a Bone has two Protuberances and one Cavity, and the end of the Bone which is articulated with it has two Cavities and one Protuberance, as the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merus</hi> and the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lna;</hi> or when a Bone at one Extremity receives ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bone, and at its other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity it is received by the ſame Bone, as the <hi>Radius</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lna.</hi> The ſecond ſort is when a Bone at one end receives another Bone, and at the other end it is received by a third Bone, as the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> do. The third is when a Bone has a Cavity which receives the long Proceſs of another Bone, which Proceſs turns in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, like the Axle-tree in a Wheel. As the ſecond Vertebra of the Neck is articulated with the firſt; but this is no true <hi>Ginglimus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond ſort of Articulation cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Synarthroſis</hi> is of two ſorts, <hi>viz.
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:59878:107"/>Sutura</hi> and <hi>Gomphoſis.</hi> The <hi>Sutura</hi> is when two Bones are mutually indent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in one another; the Teeth by which they are indented are of various Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, ſometimes they are like the Teeth of a Saw; ſometimes they are broad at their Extremities and narrow at their Baſis; ſometimes the ſides of the Teeth are likewiſe indented, and ſometimes there are little Bones be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Teeth which are alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented; theſe are moſt frequently in the <hi>Sutura Lambdoidalis,</hi> and they ſerve as wedges to keep the Teeth firm. Beſides theſe little Bones, there is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily a viſcous Humour which glews the Indentations together, and which perfectly unites them in ſeveral old Perſons.</p>
                  <p>This ſort of Articulation is called by Joiners <hi>Duftelling,</hi> and is uſed in Drawers, Cabinets, and Boxes. All the Bones of the <hi>Cranium</hi> and upper Jaw, as alſo all the <hi>Epiphiſes</hi> of the Bones are joined by this ſort of Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gomphoſis</hi> is when one Bone is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened in another, as a Pin or Nail is in a piece of Wood, and the Teeth only are articulated this way in their Sockets. Authors add a third ſort of <hi>Synarthroſis,</hi> which they call <hi>Harmonia,</hi> and by it, they ſay, the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:59878:108"/>Bones of the upper Jaw are joined to one another, but theſe Bones are joined to one another by a true Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>There is ſtill another way by which Bones are united, which Authors all <hi>Symphiſis,</hi> which ſignifies a natural growing together of the Bones. And this is either with ſome intervening Subſtance or without it. The inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening Subſtance is either a Cartilage, Ligament, or Fleſh. If it be a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilage, then it is called <hi>Synchondroſis;</hi> this way the union of the <hi>Os Pubis</hi> and of the Bodies of the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> is performed, becauſe this union remains always Cartilaginous. But the <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondroſis</hi> of the Chin is nothing but the Fibres of the lower Jaw at the Chin not as yet oſſified. If it be a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gament, then it is called <hi>Syneuroſis;</hi> and there are none united this way but the <hi>Os Hyoides</hi> to the <hi>Proceſſus Sty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loides,</hi> and the Extremity of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lna</hi> to the Bones of the <hi>Carpus.</hi> If it be Fleſh, then it is called <hi>Syſſarcoſis;</hi> this way, they ſay, the <hi>Os Hyoides</hi> and the <hi>Scapula</hi> are united. But who ſees not that the Muſcles are not for their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulation, but meerly for their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and it ſeems to be more proper to ſay that the Bones are ſeparated rather than articulated by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:59878:108"/>Muſcles. The other ſort of <hi>Symphiſis,</hi> which is when the Bones grow together, without any interve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Subſtance, is nothing but Part of the Bones not quite oſſified.</p>
                  <p>The Extremities of all the Bones in the Body that are articulated to one another for motion, except thoſe of the Ear, are covered with ſmooth and ſoft Cartilages, which greatly facilitate their motion: They are alſo ſurroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with Membranes or Ligaments which commonly riſe from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of the <hi>Epiphiſes</hi> and the Bones: Theſe Ligaments ſerve not only to ſtrengthen the Joinings, and to keep the Heads of the Bones in their Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but it is probable that they have alſo Glands which ſeparate that Muci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage which is always found in the Joints, and which is as uſeful to them as Tallow is to Coach Wheels.</p>

                  <p>In it there are a great number of Veins and Arteries, which bring blood for the Nouriſhment of the Bones.

                  <p>THE Lower Jaw is made of one Bone whoſe Fibres at the Chin, in Children do not ossifie till they are about two Years old.

The other which is ſhorter and lower has a round Head, lined with a Cartilage, which is arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated into the <hi>Sinus</hi> of the <hi>Os Petro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum;</hi> but betwixt the Cartilage which
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:59878:117"/>lines the <hi>Sinus,</hi> and that which covers the Head of this Proceſs there is a third, which adheres to the <hi>Ligamentum An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulare</hi> which ſurrounds this Articula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Motion of the Jaw ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, which is abſolutely neceſſary in chewing, is much facilitated by this looſe intervening Cartilage. The lower edge of this Jaw is called its baſis, each end of which is called the Angle of the Lower Jaw.</p>
                  <p>The Lower Jaw has four holes, two on its inſide near its Proceſſes, and two on its outſide near its middle. By the Internal holes enter a branch of the fifth Pair of Nerves, a Vein from the Jugulars, and an Artery from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotidales, which give twigs to the roots of the Teeth. By the External holes theſe ſame Veſſels come out, and are diſtributed upon the Chin. It has alſo Sixteen <hi>Sinus's</hi> into which the Teeth are ſet.</p>

<pb n="209" facs="tcp:59878:117"/>a thick, viſcous, tranſparent Humour, which, as it encreaſes, hardens in the form of Teeth, which about the ſeventh or eighth Month after Birth, begin to pierce the edge of the Jaw, tear the <hi>Perioſteum</hi> and Gums, which being very ſenſible create a violent Pain and other Symptoms incident to Children in the time of teething.</p>
                  <p>The Teeth begin not to appear all at one time; Firſt the <hi>Dentes Inciſivi</hi> of the Upper and then thoſe of the Lower Jaw appear, becauſe they are the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and ſharpeſt.

The twelve <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Back have the leaſt Motion of any, becauſe their Cartilages are thin, their acute Proceſſes are long and very near to one another; and they are fixed to the Ribs, which neither move forwards nor backwards. But the greateſt Motion of the Back is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Loins, becauſe their Cartilages are thicker, and their acute Proceſſes are at a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſtance from one another, for the thicker the Cartilages are, the more we may bend our Body forwards; and the greater diſtance there is betwixt the acute Proceſſes the more we may bend our ſelves backward.</p>
                  <p>This is the Structure and Motion of the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> when they are in their natural Poſition: but we find them alſo in ſeveral perſons ſeveral ways di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorted. If the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Back ſtick out, ſuch as have this Deformity are ſaid to be bunch-backed, and in ſuch the Cartilages which are between the <hi>vertebrae,</hi> are very thin and hard forwards, but conſiderably thick back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, where the oblique Proceſſes of
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:59878:122"/>the Superior and Inferior <hi>Vertebrae</hi> are at a conſiderable diſtance from one another, which diſtance fills up with a viſcous Subſtance. This inequality of the thickneſs of the Cartilages hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens either by a relaxation, or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Ligaments and Muſcles which are faſtened to the backſide of the <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> in which caſe their Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſts finding no oppoſition, remain in a continual Contraction, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently there can be no Motion in theſe <hi>Vertebrae.</hi> If this Deformity has been from the Womb, then the Bones being at that time ſoft and tender, the Bodies of the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> partake of the ſame inequality as the Cartilages. If the bunch be towards one Shoulder for example towards the right, then the Cartilages on that ſide are very thick, but thin and dry on the other ſide; on the left ſide the oblique <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſes</hi> come cloſe together, but on the right there is a conſiderable diſtance betwixt them; and the Ligaments and Muſcles are greatly extended on the right ſide, but thoſe on the left are as much contracted. If the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> are diſtorted inwards, all things have a different Face: The Cartilages and ſometimes the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> are very thick forwards, but mighty thin and hard backwards; the acute and oblique Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:59878:123"/>are very cloſe to one another, and the Ligaments upon the Bodies of the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> are greatly relaxed, but the Muſcles and Ligaments which tie the Proceſſes together are very much contracted. Theſe Diſtortions ſeldom happen in the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Loins, but ſuch as are ſo miſerable have little or no Motion of their Back.</p>

                  <p>THE Thigh has only one Bone, which is the longeſt of all the Bones of the Body, its Fibres are cloſe and hard; it has a Cavity in its middle, 'tis a little convex and round on its foreſide, but a little hollow, with a long and ſmall ridge called <hi>Linea Aſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> on its backſide. At its upper end it has three <hi>Epiphiſes</hi> which ſeparate ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily in Children.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is its Extremity, which is a large and round head covered with a Cartilage, which is received into the <hi>Acetabulum Coxendicis,</hi> wherein it is tied by two Ligaments. The firſt is pretty large, and comes from the edge of the <hi>Acetabulum.</hi> The ſecond is round and ſhort; it comes from the bottom of the <hi>Acetabulum,</hi> and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:59878:130"/>in the middle of the round head; the Part immediately below this round head, which is ſmall, long, and a little Oblique, is called its Neck. It makes an Angle with the Body of the Bone, by which means the Thighs are kept at a diſtance from one another, that the Muſcles on the inſide of the Thighs might lie the more conveniently with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out rubbing upon one another, or hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Privities. Beſides this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquity of the Neck of the Bone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces much to the ſtrength of the Muſcles of the Thigh; becauſe it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves their Inſertions from the Center of Motion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Trochanter major.</note>The ſecond is called <hi>Trochanter major;</hi> it is a pretty big Protuberance on the External ſide of the Thigh Bone, juſt at the root of the Neck, it is rough, becauſe of the Inſertion of ſome Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in it. It has a ſmall dent at its root, into which the <hi>Muſculi Quadra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gemini</hi> and the <hi>Obturatores</hi> are inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>

                  <p>The lower Extremity of the Thigh Bone, which is articulated with the <hi>Tibia</hi> by <hi>Ginglimus,</hi> is divided in the middle by a <hi>Sinus</hi> into two Heads
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:59878:131"/>or Protuberances, the External and the Internal, which are received into the upper <hi>Sinus's</hi> of the <hi>Tibia;</hi> thorow the ſpace which is between the hind Parts of theſe two Heads paſs the great Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and Nerve which go to the Leg.</p>
                  <p>In the Knee there is a little round Bone,<note place="margin">Patella.</note> about two Inches broad, pretty thick, a little convex on both ſides, covered with a ſmooth Cartilage on its foreſide; it is ſoft in Children, but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard in thoſe of riper Years; it is called <hi>Mola, Patella,</hi> or Pan; over it paſs the Tendons of the Muſcles which extend the Leg, to which it ſerves as a Pulley for facilitating their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>In the Leg there are two Bones,<note place="margin">Tibia.</note> the inner and bigger is called <hi>Tibia</hi> or <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile majus;</hi> 'tis hard and firm with a Cavity in its middle; 'tis almoſt tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angular; its fore and ſharp edge is called the Shin. In its upper Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity it has two large <hi>Sinus's</hi> tipt with a ſoft and ſupple Cartilage called <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilago Lunata,</hi> and divided from one another by a ſmall Production. The <hi>Sinus's</hi> receive the two Protuberances of the Thigh Bone, and the Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is received in the <hi>Sinus</hi> which divides theſe two Protuberances. On the ſide of this upper end it has a ſmall knob, which is received into a
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:59878:131"/>ſmall <hi>Sinus</hi> of the <hi>Fibula;</hi> and on its fore part a little below the <hi>Patella,</hi> it has another into which the Tendons of the Extenſors of the Leg are inſerted. Its lower Extremity, which is much ſmaller than its upper, has a remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Proceſs which forms the inner An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle, and a pretty large <hi>Sinus</hi> divided in the middle by a ſmall Protuberance; the <hi>Sinus</hi> receives the convex Head of the <hi>Aſtragulus,</hi> and the Protuberance is received into the <hi>Sinus,</hi> in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vex Head of the ſame Bone. It has another ſhallow <hi>Sinus</hi> in the ſide of its lower end, which receives the <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bula.</hi>

                     <hi>Fibula</hi> or <hi>Focile Minus;</hi> though it be much ſmaller than the <hi>Tibia,</hi> yet 'tis nothing ſhorter. It lies in the outſide of the Leg, and its upper end which is not ſo high as the Knee, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the lateral knob of the upper end of the <hi>Tibia,</hi> into a ſmall <hi>Sinus</hi> which it has in its inner ſide. Its lower end is received into the ſmall <hi>Sinus</hi> of the <hi>Tibia,</hi> and then it extends into a large Proceſs, which forms the outer Ankle, embracing the External ſide of this <hi>Aſtragulus.</hi> The <hi>Tibia</hi> and <hi>Fibula</hi> touch not one another but at their ends; the ſpace which they leave in their middle, is filled up by a ſtrong
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:59878:132"/>membranous Ligament, and ſome Muſcles which extend the Feet and Toes.</p>

                  <p>THE Eye-brows have each a Muſcle called <hi>Corrugator.</hi> It ariſes from the great Canthus of the Orbit, and terminates in the Skin about the middle of the Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brows. Some reckon this Pair only a Prolongation of the <hi>Frontales;</hi> their Name declares their Uſe.</p>
                  <p>The Noſe has three Muſcles. The firſt ariſes from the upper end of the two Bones of the Noſe; and are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted into the upper Part of the <hi>Alae.</hi> They pull the Noſe upwards.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Pair ariſe from the <hi>Os Maxillare,</hi> and are inſerted into the ſides of the <hi>Alae.</hi> They dilate the Noſtrils.</p>
                  <p>The third Pair ariſe from the ſame Bone, above the <hi>Dentes Inciſorii,</hi> and are inſerted into the Extremities of the <hi>Alae,</hi> which they pull downwards.</p>
                  <p>The Muſcles of the Lips are four Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Pair.</p>
                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:59878:135"/>
                  <p>The <hi>Inciſivus,</hi> or <hi>Elevator Labii Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perioris;</hi> it ariſes from the upper Part of the fourth Bone of the upper Jaw, and deſcending obliquely is inſerted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the upper Lip above the <hi>Dentes Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorii.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Its Antagoniſt is the <hi>Triangularis,</hi> or <hi>Depreſſor Labii Superioris;</hi> it ariſeth from the lower edge of the lower Jaw, between the <hi>Maſſater</hi> and the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dratus,</hi> and aſcendeth by the Angle of the Mouth to the upper Lip.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Caninus,</hi> or <hi>Elevator Labii In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferioris;</hi> it ariſeth from the fourth Bone of the upper Jaw, below the <hi>Inciſiv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Its Antagoniſt is the <hi>Quadratus,</hi> or <hi>Depreſſor Labii Inferioris;</hi> this is ſome thin, fleſhy Fibres, which lie imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate under the Skin, upon the Chin; they ariſe from the edge of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part of the under Jaw, and are inſerted into the upper Lip.</p>
                  <p>There are three Muſcles common to both the Lips.</p>
                  <p>The firſt and the ſecond are <hi>Zygoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tici,</hi> one on each ſide; they come from the <hi>Os Zygoma,</hi> and going obliquely they are inſerted near the Angles of the Lips. When one of theſe Muſcles act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, it draws both Lips obliquely to a
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:59878:135"/>ſide; they receive often ſome Fibres from the <hi>Caninus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third is the <hi>Orbicularis,</hi> or <hi>Sphin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter Labiorum,</hi> it ſurrounds the Lips with Orbicular Fibres; when it acteth, it draws the Lips together.</p>
                  <p>There is one Muſcle on each ſide common to the Lips and Cheeks, which is the <hi>Buccinator;</hi> it lies under the other Muſcles; it makes the inner Subſtance of the Cheeks; its Fibres run from the <hi>Proceſſus Coronae</hi> of the lower Jaw, to the Angle of the Mouth: And they adhere to the upper part of the Gums of both Jaws. Thorow its middle paſs the upper <hi>Ductus Salivales;</hi> by this Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle we contract the Cavity of our Mouth, and thruſt the Meat between our Teeth.</p>
                  <p>The Muſcles of the lower Jaw, are twelve Pair, ſix on each ſide.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is the <hi>Temporalis,</hi> or <hi>Crota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phites;</hi> it ariſes by a Semicircular fleſhy beginning from a Part of the <hi>Os Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> from the lower Part of the <hi>Parie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talis,</hi> and upper Part of the <hi>Temporalis.</hi> From thence they go under the <hi>Zygo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> and gathering together as to their Centre, they are inſerted by a ſhort, but ſtrong Tendon into the <hi>Proceſſus Coronae</hi> of the lower Jaw.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is the <hi>Maſſater;</hi> it is a thick and ſhort Muſele; it ariſes from
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:59878:136"/>the <hi>Zygoma,</hi> and from the firſt Bone of the upper Jaw, and is inſerted into the lower edge of the lower Jaw, from its External Angle to its middle. Its Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres run in three Directions; thoſe which come from the <hi>Zygoma</hi> run ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely to the middle of the Jaw; and thoſe from the firſt Bone of the upper Jaw croſs the former, and run to the Angle of the lower Jaw, and the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres which are in its middle run in a perpendicular from their Origin to their Inſertion. Theſe two Muſcles pull the Jaw upwards.</p>
                  <p>The third is the <hi>Pterigoidaeus Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus;</hi> it ariſes from the Internal Part of the <hi>Proceſſus Pterigoidaeus,</hi> and deſcends to be inſerted into the Inferior Part of the Internal ſide of the lower Jaw, near its Angle. When this Muſcle act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, it draweth the Jaw to a ſide.</p>
                  <p>The fourth is the <hi>Pterigoidaeus Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternus;</hi> it ariſeth from the External Part of the ſame Proceſs, and goes backwards, to be inſerted between the <hi>Proceſſus Condiloides</hi> and the <hi>Coronae</hi> on the inſide of the lower Jaw.

                  <p>The Muſcles which dilate the <hi>Thorax</hi> in Inſpiration are</p>

                     <pb n="251" facs="tcp:59878:139"/>and is inſerted into the ſeven true Ribs, and firſt of the falſe Ribs by ſo many diſtinct Portions, which repreſent the teeth of a Saw. The <hi>Obliquus Deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens</hi> of the <hi>Abdomen</hi> lie between the ſpaces of its lower Indentations.</p>

                  <p>When all theſe Muſcles act, they draw the Ribs upwards, bringing the Ribs to right Angles with the <hi>Vertebrae;</hi> and conſequently the Cavity of the <hi>Thorax</hi> muſt be wider and ſhorter: but becauſe at the ſame time the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts and becomes plain, therefore the Cavity is alſo longer.</p>
                  <p>The Muſcles which contract the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> are</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Intercoſtales Interni;</hi> they have the ſame Situation, Origination, and Inſertion as the <hi>Externi,</hi> with this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, that their Fibres run contrary to the Fibres of the <hi>Externi,</hi> viz. from the forepart backwards.

                  <p>It ſeems to be as proper to make the Extenſors of the <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Muſcle as three; for in effect, they are almoſt as many really diſtinct Muſcles, as there are oblique, tranſverſe and acute Proceſſes in the <hi>Vertebrae;</hi> but becauſe this would multiply the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Muſcles, and cauſe a great confuſion if they were to have all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Names, therefore it is better to call them by the Name of <hi>Muſculi Vertebrales.</hi>

                  <p>The ſecond may be called <hi>Palmaris Brevis;</hi> it lies under the <hi>Aponeuroſis</hi> of the firſt; it ariſes from the Bone of the <hi>Metacarpus</hi> that ſuſtains the little Finger, and from that Bone of the <hi>Carpus</hi> that lies above the reſt. It goes tranſverſly, &amp; is inſerted into the eighth Bone of the <hi>Carpus.</hi> The firſt aſſiſts the Hand to graſp any thing cloſely, and the ſecond makes the Palm of the Hand Concave.</p>

                  <p>The Muſcles of the Wriſt are four, two Internal for bending of it, and two External for extending it.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is the <hi>Cubitaeus Internus;</hi> it ariſes from the Internal Extuberance of the <hi>Humerus</hi> and upper Part of the <hi>

                  <p>THE Leg is bended by four Muſcles, and extended by four others. The Muſcles which bend it are,</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Seminervoſus,</hi> which ariſes from the Protuberance of the <hi>Iſchium,</hi> and is inſerted by a round Tendon into the Internal Part of the <hi>Epiphiſis</hi> of the <hi>Tibia.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Biceps,</hi> ſo called, becauſe it has two Heads, of which one comes from the tuberoſity of the <hi>Iſchium,</hi> the other from the middle of the <hi>Linea Aſpera,</hi> both which join together, and are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted by one Tendon, into the Superior and External Part of the <hi>Perone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Gracilis</hi> ariſes from the union of the <hi>Os Pubis</hi> and <hi>Iſchium,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending by the inſide of the Thigh, it grows tendinous, and is inſerted into the Superior and Internal ſide of the <hi>Tibia.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Poplitaeus;</hi> it ariſes from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and Inferior Protuberance of the Thigh Bone, and paſſing over the Joint obliquely is inſerted into the Superior and Internal Part of the <hi>Tibia.</hi> This aſſiſts in bending of the Leg, and turns it a little inwards.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Membranoſus,</hi> or <hi>Fuſcia Lata,</hi> which ariſes fleſhy from the forepart of the Spine of the <hi>Ilium,</hi> and a little below it becomes membranous or ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinous, and covers almoſt all the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Thigh and Leg down to the Foot.

                  <p>A Nerve is a long and ſmall bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of very fine Pipes, or hollow Fibres, wrapt up in the <hi>Dura</hi> and <hi>Pia Mater;</hi> which laſt not only covers them all in common, but it alſo encloſes every Fibre in particular.</p>
                  <p>The Medullary Subſtance of the Brains, is the beginning of all the Nerves; and 'tis probable that each Fibre of the Nerves anſwers to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Part of the Brain at one end, and to a particular Part of the Body at its other end, that whenever an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is made upon ſuch a Part of the Brain, the Soul may know that ſuch a Part of the Body is affected.</p>
                  <p>The Nerves do ordinarily accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Arteries thorow all the Body, that the Animal Spirits may be kept warm and moving by the continual heat and pulſe of the Arteries. They
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:59878:158"/>have alſo Blood-Veſſels as the other Parts of the Body; theſe Veſſels are not only ſpread upon their Coats, but they run alſo amongſt their Medullary Fibres, as may be ſeen amongſt the Fibres of the <hi>Retina.</hi> Where-ever any Nerve ſends out a branch, or receives one from another, or where two Nerves join together, there is generally a <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio</hi> or <hi>Plexus</hi> either leſs or more, as may be ſeen at the beginning of all the Nerves or the <hi>Medulla Spinalis,</hi> and in many other places of the Body.</p>

                  <p>The firſt of theſe Coats is woven of nervous. Fibres diſpoſed length-ways, but not altogether in a ſtraight Line. This Coat is looſe and ſtretches very eaſily, 'tis not cloſely tied to the reſt.</p>
                  <pb n="302" facs="tcp:59878:165"/>
                  <p>The ſecond is a Web of ſmall Veſſels in form of a Net, it furniſhes the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Nouriſhment to the reſt of the Coats.</p>
                  <p>The third is made of little Glands, which ſeparate the ſeroſity of the Blood brought by the Veſſels of the ſecond Coat.</p>
                  <p>The fourth is compoſed of Muſcular and Spiral Fibres, whoſe Parts ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively contracting, haſten the Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Blood.</p>
                  <p>The only reaſon why the Veins do not beat as the Arteries do, is becauſe the Blood in the Veins runs from a narrow Channel into a broader; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in the Arteries it runs from a wide Veſſel to a narrower one.</p>
                  <p>Authors do not agree about the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of the Veins. Some ſay that it is in the Heart, and ſome others will have them to riſe out of the Liver. Others think that they come from all the Parts of the Body, by their little branches which are diſtributed thorow it, where they ſay they have their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, as ſo many roots which join to make a Trunk, or as little Brooks that produce a River.

                  <p>The branches of the Veins in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as they recede from their Trunks, they divide into an infinity of little Capillary branches, which at laſt are imperceptible. Theſe Capillary bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are, ſpread thorow all the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> in the Membranes, and thorow all the Fibres of the Muſcles, to receive the Blood which was brought there by the Arteries. The Extremities of the Veins unite to all the Extremities of the Arteries: But becauſe there are more Capillary Veins than Arteries, the Veins unite with one another, and ſo likewiſe do the Arteries, that if one Branch be ſtopt, the Blood may have a Paſſage by another. Theſe Unions Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors call <hi>Anaſtomoſis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Veins have in their Cavities lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Membranes or Valves, diſpoſed at certain diſtances in ſuch a manner that they open towards the Heart, and they ſhut towards the Extremities of the Body to hinder the Blood to return, and to ſuſtain it, that by its weight it fall not back again. There are more Valves in the Veins of the Thighs, Legs, Feet, and of the Arms and Hands, than in the other Parts of the Body. There are none in the <hi>Vena Porta,</hi> the Emulgent Veins, nor in the <hi>Vena Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monaria.</hi>
                     <pb n="304" facs="tcp:59878:166"/>The openings of the Valves are diſpoſed alternatively, to the end that the Blood which eſcapes or falls back from one may be ſtopt by the next.

                  <p>The uſe of the Veins is to bring the Blood back again to the Heart from all the Parts of the Body.</p>

                  <p>The firſt is the <hi>Vena Adipoſa</hi> or <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalis,</hi> which is ſpread on the Coat and Fat that covers the Reins.</p>

                  <p>The fourth is the <hi>Vena Lumbaris,</hi> which is not always one, but often two or three on each ſide, which they divide into Superior and Inferior they are beſtowed on the Muſcles of the Loins and on the <hi>Peritonaeum.</hi> They ſometimes call the laſt branch of the <hi>Lumbaris, Muſcula Superior.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are ſome Anatomiſts that have obſerved, that there is a branch of the <hi>Lumbaris</hi> that enters the Cavity of the <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> and which aſcends to the Brain, which gave them occaſion to think againſt all probability that the ſeed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended by that Vein from the Brain.</p>
                  <p>A little below the Emulgents the great Artery goes above the <hi>Cava,</hi> and then the <hi>Cava</hi> divides into two bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches called <hi>Iliaci,</hi> becauſe they paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the <hi>Ilia</hi> to go to the Thighs.

The Internal ſends out two branches, the <hi>Muſcula Media</hi> which is ſpread thorow the Muſcles of the Thigh, the <hi>Hypogaſtrica,</hi> which is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times double, it's ſpread about the <hi>Sphincter</hi> of the <hi>Anus;</hi> wherefore 'tis called their <hi>Haemorrhoidalis Externa.</hi> The <hi>Hypogaſtrica</hi> is ſpread alſo upon the Body of the Bladder, upon the <hi>Matrix</hi> and its Neck, therefore ſome thought without ground that the Menſtrual Blood was diſcharged by this Vein which comes only from the Arteries.</p>
                  <p>The External branch of the <hi>Iliacae</hi> ſends out three branches, two before it goes out of the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> and the third after it goes out of it.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is the <hi>Vena Epigaſtrica,</hi> which comes rarely from the <hi>Cruralis,</hi> it goes to the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> aſcends to the <hi>Muſculi Recti,</hi> where it Rencon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres the <hi>Mammariae,</hi> with which it communicates by <hi>Anaſtomoſis.</hi>

The <hi>Saphena</hi> turns towards the upper Part of the Foot, where it gives ſeveral branches, of which ſome go to the great Toe.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is the <hi>Iſcias Minor,</hi> this Vein is little; 'tis ſpent on the Muſcles and Skin which are about the upper Joint of the <hi>Femur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third is the <hi>Muſcula Externa,</hi> becauſe it goes to the External Muſcles of the Thigh, on the other ſide of the <hi>Cruralis,</hi> juſt oppoſite to the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Vein, there goes out ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther called <hi>Muſcula Interna,</hi> which goes to the Internal Muſcles of the Thigh.</p>
                  <p>The fourth is the <hi>Poplitaea</hi> made of two different branches united together; it goes ſtraight down by the Ham to the Heel; it lies pretty deep, upon which account it can hardly be opened. The branches which appear in this place are not of this Vein.</p>
                  <p>The fifth is the <hi>Suralis,</hi> which is pretty big, and which divides into

                  <p>The <hi>Suralis</hi> diſtributes its branches upon the fat of the Leg, and makes with the branches of the <hi>Poplitaea,</hi> all thoſe <hi>Plexus</hi> of Veins which are conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous, on the upper Part of the Foot.</p>
                  <p>The ſixth and laſt branch of the <hi>Cruralis</hi> is the <hi>Iſcias major,</hi> which goes alſo to the Muſcles and fat of the Leg, and is divided afterwards into ſeveral branches, which are diſtributed to the Toes.</p>

                  <p>The Lympha which the Veſſels con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain comes from the Seroſity of the Blood which is ſeparate in the Glands. Some Authors think, that it comes alſo from the <hi>Succus Nervoſus,</hi> which is brought by the Nerves to the Glands; it's ordinarily clear and tranſparent, but it changes its colour according as 'tis tinctured by the Chyle, Bile, Blood, and other Humours. 'Tis inſipid of it ſelf, but ſometimes 'tis acid, ſalt, or bitter. It coagulates ſometimes by the mixture of Liquors and diſſolution of Salts, as the Seroſity of the Blood, and when it's dryed, it has a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Smell.</p>
                  <p>If you examine it Chymically, you may draw from it much volatile but no fixt Salt, ſome Phlegm, and Sulphur, and a little Earth. Acids coagulate it, and Volatile Spirits diſſolve it.</p>
                  <p>The Lympha ſerves to liquiſie the Chyle and Blood, that thereby they may the more eaſily move. Some think
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:59878:173"/>it ſerves to nouriſh and augment the Body: But if we conſider its Nature, and the Parts it diſcharges it ſelf into, 'tis more probable, that 'tis a proper <hi>Menſtruum</hi> for the laſt and fineſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the Chyle. It hinders the diſſipation of the Spirits; it helps to make Fermentations; it temperates the Acrimony of the Bile and Acids; it diſſolves Salts.</p>
                  <p>The breaking of the Lymphatick Veſſels, is often the cauſe of Dropſies.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>WIllis</hi> hath demonſtrated that the Arteries have four Coats, as well as the Veins.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is thin and nervous; its inner is woven of little Veins, Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and Nerves, whoſe Extremities terminate in the other Coats.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Coat adheres to the firſt; in it there are an infinite number of little white Glands.</p>
                  <p>The third is muſculous, made of many Spiral Fibres, which are cloſe to one another.</p>
                  <p>The fourth and laſt is a Coat, whoſe Fibres are in a ſtraight Line.</p>
                  <p>The Blood which is neceſſary for the nouriſhment of theſe Coats, is
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:59878:174"/>brought to them by the little Arteries, and that which remains, is brought back by the Veins; the Seroſity is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated by the Glands, and the Animal Spirits are brought by the Nerves to the muſcular Fibres of the Coats, for the aſſiſting the Pulſe of the Arteries.</p>
                  <p>The beating of the Arteries, as well as that of the Heart, is nothing elſe, but what we call <hi>Syſtole</hi> and <hi>Diaſtole.</hi> It is done, as much by the Structures of the Fibres of the Heart and Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as by the Blood, which being thruſt with Violence by the Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Fibres of the Heart into the <hi>Aorta,</hi> dilates its Fibres, becauſe it is thruſt from a wide paſſage into a narrow one, the Fibres being once di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, by their ſpring contract again, and ſo thruſt the Blood to their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, as faſt as they receive it from the Heart.</p>
                  <p>The Uſe of the Arteries is to carry the Blood to all the Parts of the Body. It is hard to diſtinguiſh the Capillary branches of the Arteries from thoſe of the Veins, if it is not by the Injection of tinctured Liquors.</p>
                  <p>The Capillary branches throughout all the Body, unite with one another as well as with the Veins.</p>

                  <p>THE <hi>Aorta</hi> coming from the left Ventricle of the Heart ſends out two branches called <hi>Coronariae,</hi> before it pierces the <hi>Pericardium,</hi> but after it hath pierced it, it aſcends a little, and then it crooks downwards and forms the <hi>Aorta Deſcendens.</hi> From the upper ſide of this Crook it ſends out three branches, two on the left ſide, which are one Subclavian, and one Carotide, one on the right ſide which is the right Subclavian, from which imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately riſes the right Carotide.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Arteria Subclavia</hi> on each ſide ſend out the <hi>Mediaſtina,</hi> the <hi>Intercoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis Superior;</hi> the <hi>Mammaria,</hi> the <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicalis</hi> or <hi>Vertebralis,</hi> and the <hi>Muſcula</hi> which goes to the Muſcles of the Neck, of the Breaſt, and to the <hi>Glandulae Thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roides.</hi> After that the <hi>Subclavia</hi> hath paſſed thorow the <hi>Muſculus Scalenus,</hi> it is called <hi>Axillaris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Arteriae Carotides,</hi> as they aſcend on each ſide of the <hi>Trachea Arteria,</hi> give ſome ſmall branches to the <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chea Arteria,</hi> to the <hi>Larynx,</hi> to the <hi>Glandula Thyroides,</hi> and then they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide into two branches, the one Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, the other External.</p>
                  <pb n="322" facs="tcp:59878:175"/>
                  <p>The External Carotide ſends out four branches.</p>
                  <p>The firſt goes to the Tongue, to the Muſcles of the <hi>Os Hyoides,</hi> and to the <hi>Pharynx.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond divides into two bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, of which the firſt loſes it ſelf in the Muſcles <hi>Milohyoides</hi> and <hi>Digaſtrici;</hi> and the ſecond goes along the baſis of the lower Jaw, and is loſt in the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Lips.</p>
                  <p>The third branch of the External Carotide divides at the Angle of the lower Jaw into two branches; one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into the lower Jaw, and the other makes the <hi>Arteria Temporalis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fourth branch of the External Carotide goes to the Muſcles on the hind Part of the Neck, and to the Skin of the hind Head.</p>
                  <p>The Internal Carotide paſſes thorow the Canal in the <hi>Os Petroſum,</hi> gives ſome branches to the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> joins with the <hi>Cervicalis,</hi> ſends out branches to the <hi>Glandula Pituitaria, Plexus Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roides,</hi> then it runs thorow all the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvolutions of the <hi>Cerebrum</hi> and <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebellum,</hi> and loſes its Capillary bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in their Cortical Subſtance.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Axillaris,</hi> having pierced the <hi>Scalenum,</hi> gives ſome little branches to the neareſt Muſcles; it ſends out the <hi>Thoracica Superior</hi> and <hi>Inferior,</hi> the <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularis,</hi>
                     <pb n="323" facs="tcp:59878:175"/>and then it gives a branch, which paſſes under the Head of the <hi>Humerus</hi> into the <hi>Muſculus Longus</hi> and <hi>Brevis</hi> of the Arm.</p>
                  <p>The Trunk of the <hi>Axillaris</hi> goes down the inſide of the Arm, giving branches by the way to the Muſcles that lie upon the <hi>Humerus.</hi> Above the Elbow it ſends out a branch, which is ſpread upon the Internal Condile of the <hi>Humerus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At the bending of the Elbow this ſame Trunk divides into two branches, the one External, and the other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal.</p>
                  <p>The External runs along the <hi>Radius,</hi> it caſts out a branch which goes to the <hi>Supinator,</hi> and aſcends to the <hi>Brachialis Internus,</hi> in the reſt of its courſe down to the Wriſt, it gives branches to the <hi>Longus, Rotundus,</hi> and benders of the Fingers, Wriſt, and Thumb.

                  <p>The Internal branch goes down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the <hi>Cubitus</hi> to the Wriſt, and is diſtributed to the middle Finger,
